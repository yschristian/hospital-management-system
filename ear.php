	<p>If you have a health problem with your head or neck, your doctor might recommend that you see an otolaryngologist. That's someone who treats issues in your ears, nose, or throat as well as related areas in your head and neck. They're called ENT's for short.

    In the 19th century, doctors figured out that the ears, nose, and throat are closely connected by a system of tubes and passages. They made special tools to take a closer look at those areas and came up with ways to treat problems. A new medical specialty was born.

     What Conditions Do Otolaryngologists Treat?
     ENT's can do surgery and treat many different medical conditions. You would see one if you have a problem involving:

    An ear condition, such as an infection, hearing loss, or trouble with balance
    Nose and nasal issues like allergies, sinusitis, or growths
   Throat problems like tonsillitis, difficulty swallowing, and voice issues
   Sleep trouble like snoring or obstructive sleep apnea, in which your airway is narrow or blocked and it interrupts your breathing while you sleep
   Infections or tumors (cancerous or not) of your head or neck
    Some areas of your head are treated by other kinds of doctors. For example, neurologists deal with problems with your brain or nervous system, and ophthalmologists care for your eyes and vision.</p>
