	<h1>1.Medical confidentiality</h1>
	<p>   
Medical confidentiality is a set of rules that limits access to information discussed between a person and their healthcare practitioners. 

With only a few exceptions, anything you discuss with your doctor must, by law, be kept private between the two of you and the organisation they work for. This is also known as doctor–patient confidentiality.

When you go to a new doctor, you can choose whether to share your previous medical records with them by giving your written consent to your other doctors, so that they can send your new doctor the information in your medical file. 
	</p>

	<h1>2.Privacy in healthcare</h1>
	<p> 
Privacy in a healthcare situation means that what you tell your healthcare provider, what they write down about you, any medication you take and all other personal information is kept private. You have a legal right to this privacy, and there are laws that guide health service providers in how they collect and record information about your health, how they must store it, and when and how they use and share it. 

You can give any of your health professionals your consent to share your health information, for example, when you change doctors and you want your new doctor to have access to your medical history. You also have a legal right to access your health information. </p>

	<h1>3.Exemptions to Privacy Laws</h1>
<p>
There are two types of situations where a health service may use or share your health information without your consent. These are:
<ul><li>
when your or someone else’s health or safety are seriously threatened and the information will help, such as if you are unconscious and paramedics, doctors and nurses need to know if you are allergic to any drugs</li>
<li>	
when the information will reduce or prevent a serious threat to public health or safety, for example, if you have a serious contagious illness and the public needs to be warned.</li>
	
There are certain exemptions that may apply in law enforcement situations and in a court of law. 

Health information privacy laws only apply rights to living people. They do not apply once the person is deceased.
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h1>4.Managing your own health information</h1>
	<p>
You own your health information and decide who can access it. You always have the right to access it yourself by asking for a copy. You can keep a personal health record at home or via the free eHealth system, which is a secure online summary of your health information, run by the Commonwealth Government.

You control what goes into your eHealth record, and who is allowed to access it. You can add or delete information or change who has the right to access your record by changing the information online or by writing a letter stating the changes to eHealth. It allows you to choose which of your doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers can view and share your health information to provide you with the best possible care.</p>
 

<h1>5.Managing someone else’s health information</h1>
	<p>
If you are a parent or guardian, you can access the health information of the children in your care. For someone who is over 18 years old, you can become their authorised representative if you have been given medical power of attorney, or if they have nominated you in an advance care plan
